# Advertising Click Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on various features related to their online behavior and demographics. The dataset, `advertising.csv`, includes information such as daily time spent on site, age, income, and more. Using machine learning algorithms, we build a model to predict the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad.

## Dataset
The dataset `advertising.csv` contains the following features:
- **Daily Time Spent on Site**: Consumer time on site in minutes.
- **Age**: Customer age in years.
- **Area Income**: Average income of the geographical area of the consumer.
- **Daily Internet Usage**: Average minutes a day the consumer is on the internet.
- **Ad Topic Line**: Headline of the advertisement.
- **City**: City of the consumer.
- **Male**: Indicates whether the consumer is male (1) or not (0).
- **Country**: Country of the consumer.
- **Timestamp**: Time at which the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window.
- **Clicked on Ad**: Target variable (0 or 1), indicating whether the consumer clicked on the ad.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a user will click on an advertisement based on the provided features.

## Project Structure
- `advertising.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `main.ipynb`: python notebook containing all the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).
